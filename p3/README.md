## Feature summary
My Project 3 was created to help users find new workouts to try. A user can either input form data or have it all completely randomized. The user can continue to generate workouts until satisfied. If the user likes the workout, he/she can save it and view it later, until the user chooses to delete it.

+ Users can register/log in
+ Users can create workouts based on specific criteria (body parts, abs included, cardio)
+ Users can continually generate new workouts based on the initial criteria until satisfied with the output
+ Once the user likes a workout, the user can save it
+ Users can view all of their saved workouts
+ Users can delete workouts that they no longer want to use
+ Users can click a button to generate a random workout without inputting any data, and save it if wanted
+ The home page is used to create new workouts, and display a table of the current user's saved workouts
